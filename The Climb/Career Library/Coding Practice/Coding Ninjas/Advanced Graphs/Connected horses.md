# Connected horses

[[The Climb/Career Library/Coding Practice/Coding Practice]] · [[The Climb/Career Library/Coding Practice/Coding Ninjas/Coding Ninjas]]

## Problem

You all must be familiar with the chess-board having 
8*8 squares of alternate black and white cells. Well, here 
we have for you a similar 
N*M size board with similar arrangement of black and white 
cells.
A few of these cells have Horses placed over them. 
Each horse is unique. Now these horses are not the 
usual horses which could jump to any of the 
8 positions they usually jump in. They can move only if there is another horse on one of the 8-positions that it can     go to usually and then both the horses will swap their positions. This swapping can happen infinitely times.
A photographer was assigned to take a picture of all the different ways that the horses occupy the board! Given the state of the board, calculate answer. Sincethis answer may be quite large, calculate in modulo 
10^9+7

### Input

First line contains 
T which is the number of test cases.
T test cases follow first line of each containing three integers 
N, M and Q where 
N,M is the size of the board and 
Q is the number of horses on it.

Q lines follow each containing the 2 integers 
X and Y which are the coordinates of the Horses.

### Output

For each test case, output the number of photographs taken by photographer.

### Constraints

 1<=T<=10
 1<=N,M<=1000
 1<=Q<=N*M

### SAMPLE INPUT

```text

### SAMPLE OUTPUT

```text
